# Air Assult Game
A Type of Arcade Game in which a copter is moving as the Game start.It's a Challenging and Addictive Game In Which You Have To Avoid All Obstacles Getting In Your Way. As Soon As The Game Starts, Your Copter Automatically Moves Forward While You Only Have To Balance It Throughout The Passage Of The BLOCKS.

# Requirements

1. Operating System(Windows, Linux, etc)

2. Python Ide(Anaconda , Jupyter notebook etc)

3. Pygame Module

# ABOUT PYTHON
1.Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. 
2. Python is a dynamic, high-level, free open source, and interpreted programming language.
3. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural-oriented programming/
4. In Python, we don’t need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language. For example, x = 10 Here, x can be anything such as String, int, etc.
        
## What can Python do?
        • Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
        • Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
        • Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
        • Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
        • Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
        • PYTHON IS LARGELY USED IN GAME DEVELOPMENT.
## WHY PYTHON ?
        • Python works on different platforms (Windows,Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
        • Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
        • Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
        • Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
        • Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.
        • PYTHON HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF INBUILT MODULES LIKE MATH,PYGAME ETC AND WE ARE GOING TO USE PYGAME LIBRARY FOR OUR GAME.

## ABOUT PYGAME
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to
be used with the Python programming language.

## INSTALLING OF PYGAME IN PYTHON
          • pip install pygame


After this command the pygame is installed in our python editior.
