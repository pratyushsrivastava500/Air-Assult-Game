# ABOUT PYTHON
--> Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
--> It is used for
* web development
* software development,
* mathematics,
* system scripting.
* Game Development
* Data Science and Machine Learning
        
## What can Python do?
        • Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
        • Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
        • Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
        • Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
        • Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
        • PYTHON IS LARGELY USED IN GAME DEVELOPMENT.
## WHY PYTHON ?
        • Python works on different platforms (Windows,Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
        • Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
• Python has syntax that allows developers to
write programs with fewer lines than some
other programming languages.
• Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning
that code can be executed as soon as it is
written. This means that prototyping can be
very quick.
• Python can be treated in a procedural way, an
object-orientated way or a functional way.
• PYTHON HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF INBUILT MODULES
LIKE MATH,PYGAME ETC AND WE ARE GOING TO USE
PYGAME LIBRARY FOR OUR GAME.

of Python modules designed for writing
video games. It includes computer graphics
and sound libraries designed to
be used with the Python programming
language.
INSTALLING OF PYGAME IN PYTHON
THE COMMAND THAT IS USED FOR INSTALLING
PYGAME IN OUR PYTHON IS:
