# ABOUT PYTHON
1.Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. 
2. Python is a dynamic, high-level, free open source, and interpreted programming language.
3. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural-oriented programming/
4. In Python, we don’t need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language. For example, x = 10 Here, x can be anything such as String, int, etc.
        
## What can Python do?

        • Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
        • Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
        • Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
        • Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
        • PYTHON IS LARGELY USED IN GAME DEVELOPMENT.
## WHY PYTHON ?
        • Python works on different platforms (Windows,Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
        • Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
        • Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
        • Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
        • Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.
        • PYTHON HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF INBUILT MODULES LIKE MATH,PYGAME ETC AND WE ARE GOING TO USE PYGAME LIBRARY FOR OUR GAME.

## ABOUT PYGAME
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to
be used with the Python programming language.

## INSTALLING OF PYGAME IN PYTHON
          • pip install pygame


After using this command on command prompt the pygame is installed in our python editior.
